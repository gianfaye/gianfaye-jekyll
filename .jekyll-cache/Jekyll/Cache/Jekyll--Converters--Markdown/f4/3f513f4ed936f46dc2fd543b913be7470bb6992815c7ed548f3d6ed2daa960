<p>If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, <a href="mailto:contact@gianfaye.com">contact me</a> and I will send you my CV. My current expertise is on front-end development and UX.  If you would read this article: <a href="http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/">The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers</a> Iâ€™d be 70% The Creative, 30% The Coder. Iâ€™m more avid to the markup and styling side of things but I can work with vanilla JS, jQuery, and REST APIs.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If Iâ€™m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, Iâ€™ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
