<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>I have been working on <strong>user interfaces</strong> for the web since 2010. I started with customizing blog templates during the blogging era in 2009 (remember blogspot?), then creating and setting up a website and CMS from the ground up (without WordPress), setting up web hosts (ugh, cPanel), setting up DNS, uploading via FTPs, editing code in VIM and updating web pages via SSH, aaaand fast forward to using version control (Git and Subversion), integrating with APIs and creating single-page applications (SPA).</p>

<p>My approach to design is mainly intuitive but I’m familiar with most of the textbook concepts such as the Gestalt principles and common design patterns.</p>

<p>My current snack is <strong>ReactJS</strong> messing up with components and states.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If I’m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, I’ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
