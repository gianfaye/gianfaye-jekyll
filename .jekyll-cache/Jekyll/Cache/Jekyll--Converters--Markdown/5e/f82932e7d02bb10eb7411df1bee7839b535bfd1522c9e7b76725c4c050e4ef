<p>This is my initial trial of <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch App</a> by Bohemian Coding. I haven’t read or watched any tutorials for Sketch for the purpose of testing how user-friendly the app would be for a new user. I’m an avid <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> user and I will be applying what I’m already familiar with in terms of the common graphic design tools.</p>

<p>For this example, I’ll be showing you how to create the <a href="http://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/metatrons-cube">Metatron’s Cube</a> on Sketch App. I used Google Hangouts for the recording and just selected a free audio sample from YouTube that’s why you will only hear the audio in the beginning. I didn’t bother to edit the recording to fast-forward as you can set it under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Settings &gt; Speed &gt; 2</code> on the video itself. Enjoy!</p>

<p>Completed in less than 30 minutes. Still needs a little polishing but not bad for the first trial.</p>
