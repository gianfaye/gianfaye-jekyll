<p>If you would read this article: <a href="http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/">The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers</a> Iâ€™d be <strong>The Core</strong> â€“ heading towards being full-stack.</p>

<p>My approach to design is mainly intuitive but Iâ€™m familiar with most of the textbook concepts such as Gestalt principles and common design patterns.</p>

<p>My current snack is <strong>ReactJS</strong> messing up with components and states.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If Iâ€™m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, Iâ€™ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
