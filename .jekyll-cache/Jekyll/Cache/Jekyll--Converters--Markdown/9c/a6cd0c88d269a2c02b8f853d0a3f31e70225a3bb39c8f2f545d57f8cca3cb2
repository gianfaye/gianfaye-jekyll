<p>While I was taking up my internship at <a href="http://infomaninc.com/">InfoMan</a>, they made me create a cooperative loan system for them. I developed the software using a proprietary business language they use for their clients - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEdge/_Advanced/_Business/_Language">Progress Open Edge ABL</a>.</p>

<p>I self-studied the language first but had a difficult time gathering resources and tutorials as the language is proprietary.</p>

<p>I swear it is one of the most <a href="https://blog.abevoelker.com/progress/_openedge/_abl/_considered/_harmful/">horrifying</a> <a href="http://www.oehive.org/node/1913">languages</a> ever built in the history of the information age. Learning it makes you want to pull your hair out and realizing itâ€™s not worth it.</p>
