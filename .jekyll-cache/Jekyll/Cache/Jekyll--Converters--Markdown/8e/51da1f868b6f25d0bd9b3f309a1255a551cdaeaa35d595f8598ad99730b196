<h2 id="quick-overview">Quick Overview</h2>

<p>I have been working on <strong>user interfaces</strong> for the web since 2010. It starts with <small>[ <em>takes a deep breath</em> ]</small> customizing blog templates during the blogging era <small>[ remember blogspot? <small>[ seriously, I started during the Friendster and Multiply era but let’s not dwell on that OKAY</small> ]</small>, then creating and setting up a website and CMS from the ground up <small>[ without WordPress ]</small>, setting up web hosting <small>[ ugh, cPanel 🙄 ]</small>, setting up DNS (A records and stuff), uploading via FTP 😬, editing code in VIM and updating web pages via SSH 😖 — <em>aaaand</em> fast forward to using version control (Git and Subversion), creating my own design system and brand bible for companies, customizing Shopify Liquid templates, creating SVGs and Symbols in Sketch, integrating with APIs and creating single-page applications (SPA). From Notepad ++ to Sublime Text to Webstorm <em>not</em> real quick.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If I’m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, I’ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
