<p>If you may have read on <a href="/blog/too-much-happenings">my previous entry</a>, I resigned from my full-time position at The Fookien Times Yearbook Publishing Co, the mother company of <a href="/project/pulp-magazine-live">PULP Magazine</a> and <a href="/project/pulp-live-world">PULP Live World Production</a>. However, I‚Äôll still be working part-time as their webmaster.</p>

<p>In this post, I‚Äôd like to dedicate some space in summarizing my 2-year experience working at PULP. <strong>LIVE LOUD</strong> is PULP Magazine‚Äôs tagline.</p>

<p>**Some inside story how I got into PULP‚Ä¶ **</p>

<p>Well, I was just browsing my Facebook feed and saw their post that they were looking for web developers to join them. I was not seriously looking for a job that time (I was still in Cavite) and I just tried since I‚Äôm into web development. And so I submitted my resume via email and got a prompt response for an interview.</p>

<p>Yikes, I have to travel for about 3 hrs and didn‚Äôt know exactly where the office was. And I was not familiar with the places on Metro Manila that time because I live in the province.</p>

<p>But hell to that, I was so excited because if you know me in high school, I am a song hits freak. <strong>Song hits</strong>, if you might remember, is what we call those music magazines with lyrics and guitar chords embedded on them. Although there are lots of open discussions whether song hits are to be considered as music magazines but you get the idea. And also not all of the chords are correct and we all made fun of it. But Internet killed the song hits and you can now easily search for the tabs and video covers on YouTube. Boohoo.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm an avid magazine collector. This is a picture of my music magazines and song hits collection back then (lower shelf), together with my books and other stuff (circa 2008):</p>

<p>I was told during the interview that they got lots of resumes piled and they chose mine. Maybe it‚Äôs the design of the resume that got their attention. It was actually inspired by David Malan‚Äôs CV. If you are familiar with open courses, David Malan is a professor at <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a> at Harvard Extension School. He‚Äôs my all-time favorite professor, by the way. :)</p>

<p>And so I got hired and‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>11/19/2011</strong> - 4 days after my first day on PULP, I got the opportunity to watch <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150376409692896.358750.759167895&amp;type=3&amp;l=8c3042754a%C2%A0">Children of Bodom Live in Manila</a>. This is a photo taken during the Meet &amp; Greet. Alexi Laiho is looking at me and Jaska is looking at the camera. Good times. Heh.</p>

<p><strong>11/28/2011</strong> - The 2011 Philippines Yearbook Launch. As you have read above, The Fookien Times is the mother company of the PULP brand. I quite enjoyed this one though, it‚Äôs a refreshing experience to see what these known people are up to during these type of events. Here‚Äôs a photo of me with the hardworking ladies of Fookien Times.</p>

<p><strong>02/18-19/2012</strong> - This is the start of the most exciting year ever, 2012. I got the opportunity to go with our road managers to assist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gianfaye/media_set?set=a.10150561881467896.384435.759167895&amp;type=3">Lamb of God and The Black Dahlia Murder</a> on their concert last Feb. 18, 2012. I can say that this is one of the events I‚Äôll remember for the rest of my life. I also got the chance to join them on their after party and watch them do sorts of shit. Funny shit.</p>

<p><strong>04/28-29/2012</strong> - And the most awaited yearly music festival, PULP Summer Slam. I‚Äôve been to PSS in the past: 2006, 2010, and 2011. The 2012 theme was The Apostles (following Christians‚Äô 12 apostles, I presume) where I got the chance to see <a href="http://pulpliveworld.com/shows/summer-slam/pulp-summer-slam-12-the-apostles">Arch Enemy, August Burns Red, Blessthefall, Darkest Hour, Periphery, and We Came As Romans</a>.

It was one of those tough experiences I‚Äôll always remember.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs quite difficult to merge all the happenings on the span of 2 years within one post. I‚Äôm really grateful to be a part of the PULP Crew and this have always been a lifechanging episode.</p>

<p>It is not the number of concerts I‚Äôve been to or the number of artists I got to see and interact with in real life. What I‚Äôll miss the most is the everyday fun of being a part of PULP family.</p>
