<p><strong>“Doesn’t work”</strong> is a killer reply to every constructive tutorial, every comprehensive material, and every ingenious invention ever created.</p>

<p>It is an ignorant’s way of saying <em>“yeah man I don’t know how to use it so it doesn’t work.”</em></p>

<p>Don’t be that lazy not to even explain why it <em>“doesn’t work”</em> and <em>“why it doesn’t work only to you.”</em></p>
