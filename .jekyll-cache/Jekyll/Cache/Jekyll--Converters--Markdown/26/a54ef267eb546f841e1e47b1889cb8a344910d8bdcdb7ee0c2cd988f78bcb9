<h2 id="the-singularity">The Singularity</h2>

<p>Most talks I stumbled upon are fairly technical, but the statistics he showed got me instantly glued. I mean, every phrase you‚Äôd react like ‚ÄúHoly shit that is sooo true‚Äù and shake your head and be somehow thankful you were alive in this timeline of the graph. Well, actually not. The singularity is upon us, and so is <em>crapularity</em>.</p>

<h2 id="wild-realization">Wild Realization</h2>

<p>It has been on my mind lately‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been thinking if there is a way I could avoid all the bullshit. To be frank, unless you isolate yourself on a four-walled room without any way out, it is impossible to elimite all the crap. It‚Äôs been following us wherever we go, whenever it is, whichever platform we are using.</p>

<h2 id="transpositioning-crap">Transpositioning Crap</h2>

<p>I for once has self-proclaimed to stop patronizing any live tv shows and stop watching the telly in general. Those were the times I had converted myself to a total Internet techie. However, as seeing things now, even in YouTube you can‚Äôt avoid the annoyance anymore. I don‚Äôt even know why I keep seeing the same ads over and over and over again. It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense and it‚Äôs a total waste of time. Just like in the tv. There is crap, then there is repetitive crap.</p>

<h2 id="ads-are-browser-germs">Ads are Browser Germs</h2>

<p>Never once had I participated in any web design/dev‚Äôt project where I have to place a section for ads. Hell, I know I‚Äôm not alone when I say most blogs out there contain ads in before and after the main content. It‚Äôs a disease. Aesthetic cancer. C‚Äômon let‚Äôs be serious. Do you really think most ads you see on the sites you visit have been clicked even <em>once</em>? That‚Äôs why most of websites and blogs I often visit are those with only one or two columns and zero ads. It looks neat and it gives you more focus to the content rather than loading tons of different crap per web page. Please keep you websites germ-free. But I can say, 1 or 2 ads which blends well with the layout is acceptable, like those Carbon ads you see on some good tutorial articles. I guess you can call them good bacteria? Like those <em>Lactobacilli shirota strain</em> on Yakult.</p>

<h2 id="innovate-to-crapulate">Innovate to Crapulate</h2>

<p>Since Google implemented the tabbed category on Gmail (Inbox, Promotions, Social, Updates, etc.) I‚Äôve never had a zero inbox status. <em>Why?</em> Plainly because they added another section to manage and you have something to prioritize to empty (Inbox) which gets you to think that when you empty the Inbox, everything is clean unless you click the other tabs and unveil the horror. It‚Äôs a <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/shit-work/">shit work</a>, mostly if you always sort out your emails to folders, that you have to go visit another folder to transfer the contents to another folder, so you could empty that folder with another folder in line to empty.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-info-please">No More Info, Please</h2>

<p>On 2009, I named my blog <a href="http://the.loading-info.net">Loading-Info</a> because, mainly I was an IT student, and because I was too enthusiastic (and naive) and thought infinite information access is a nirvana. After years I then realized there are bad consequences. Like your hearing, too much noise could make your ears bleed until you can‚Äôt hear what‚Äôs music or what‚Äôs noise anymore. There are lots of services that helps you sort out what‚Äôs good from crap. Hint: not Facebook. But <em>lots</em> of services is still a problem need to be sorted out.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>Well, I‚Äôve had planned on creating <a href="/colophon">this website via Jekyll</a> since last year. I just had the <em>right goals</em> this month that‚Äôs why I started and finished it.</p>

<p>I wanted it to be done just so I could eliminate the online hubs I‚Äôm going to (or be needing to) visit (hopefully) in the near future. I‚Äôm pointing at you, Facebook. But since my phone is broken. (Which I‚Äôm quite enjoying for a while now.) I may need to find a way to not totally cut the cord with my connections. So maybe that‚Äôs why I decided I really needed to put up this website.</p>

<p>It would really help you focus on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2Spix4QZwk">what matters</a> if you don‚Äôt have access to lots of nonsense crap that is clouding the interwebs lately. Or better yet, create/do better things and overpower the 90% <em>crap mentality</em>.</p>
