<p>Most new hires have the penchant to impress their boss. And so they suggest things that seem good, their ideas overflow with passion, et cetera, up to the point that they even suggest very bad ideas.</p>

<p>Regular employees may find this attitude a bit distracting. Why canâ€™t they just do their job, as normal as a regular employee, without having to impress their boss?</p>

<p>Having to impress your boss as your first task within the organization is going to be your next downfall. Your first task should be to observe how the organization works. Follow the work flow, where it leads to even the tiniest stream. By knowing the organization and the people within the organization you are saving yourself from being seen as that guy who just wants to impress his boss in disregard to his working environment and colleagues.</p>
