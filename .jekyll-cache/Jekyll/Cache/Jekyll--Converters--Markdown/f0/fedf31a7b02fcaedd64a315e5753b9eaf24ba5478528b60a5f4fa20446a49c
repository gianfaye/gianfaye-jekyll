<p>I happen to chance running into this video from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgeekph/">WebGeekPH Facebook group</a>.</p>

<p>A number of developers around the world could relate, not specifically with what they indicated on their boards, but you get the gist.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-really-need">What we really need</h2>

<p>Of course, it’s a video created for fun. But it tackles an important part on the developer workforce and how we wanted to be treated as a developer.</p>

<p>While writing this, I, myself, am suffering from a consequence I didn’t sign up for. I am stuck at home, writing this post on Sublime Text, because I can’t go to work in the office.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All I wanted was to get to my desk, code, and finish something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>*insert some lengthy rant which I decided to cut*</strong></p>

<p>I wish I could get them this book: <a href="https://leanpub.com/nightowls">“Why Programmers Work At Night”</a> or better yet <a href="http://amzn.to/18ekKGP">“Linchpin” by Seth Godin</a>.</p>

<p>If you are an employer, you might want to make your developer employees suffer less by (1) <strong>understanding what they actually do</strong>, (2) <strong>working your ass off to be able to pay them adequately</strong>, and (3) <strong>provide flexible schedule on their working days</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creativity is intelligence having fun. - Albert Einstein</p>

<p>As most of the people didn’t know, <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/">programming is a creative endeavor</a>. We are not automated machines, we are <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity/">creative</a> human beings who enjoy technical challenges and have bills to pay.</p>

<p>We need no hugs, we demand better treatment. No, we deserve them.</p>

<p>If you can’t provide them then you do not deserve us.</p>
