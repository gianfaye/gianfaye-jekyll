<p><strong>PULP Magazine</strong> is the premier music publication in the Philippines since 1999.</p>

<h2 id="the-site">The Site</h2>

<p>The website serves as a preview portal of the latest published issue and as a wayback machine, which provides information of their back issues. We built a custom CMS and features different sections (e.g. News, Blog, Column, Reviews) to publish different types of content which is all managed through an admin panel we also developed in PHP/MySQL.</p>

<p>We also spiced it with a helpful locator widget called “Where to buy PULP?” where visitors can search which stores they can get a grab on the latest issue of PULP Magazine.</p>
