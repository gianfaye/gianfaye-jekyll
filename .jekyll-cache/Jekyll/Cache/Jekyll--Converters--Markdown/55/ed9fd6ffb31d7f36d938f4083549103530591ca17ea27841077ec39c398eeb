<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If Iâ€™m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, Iâ€™ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
