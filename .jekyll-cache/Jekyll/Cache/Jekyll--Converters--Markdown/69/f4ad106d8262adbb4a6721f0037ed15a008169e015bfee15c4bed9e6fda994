<p>I’m <strong>Gian Faye Paguirigan</strong>. UI is my game, it’s embedded in my name <em>(literally)</em>.</p>

<p>I have been working on <strong>user interfaces</strong> on the web since 2010 and I’m currently focused on <strong>front-end development</strong> and <strong>user experience design</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, <a href="mailto:contact@gianfaye.com">contact me</a> and I will send you my CV. My current expertise is on <strong>front-end development</strong> and <strong>user experience design</strong>.</p>

<p>If you would read this article: <a href="http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/">The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers</a> I’d be <strong>The Core</strong> – heading towards being full-stack.</p>

<p>My approach to design is mainly intuitive but I’m familiar with most of the textbook concepts such as the Gestalt principles and common design patterns.</p>

<p>My current snack is <strong>ReactJS</strong> messing up with components and states.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in <strong>forensic science</strong> specializing in <strong>computer forensics</strong>, anything about <strong>InfoSec</strong>, the <strong>maker culture</strong>, and the <strong>Internet of Things</strong>. If I’m not tinkering stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg">the internet</a>, I’ll probably be tinkering things IRL.</p>
