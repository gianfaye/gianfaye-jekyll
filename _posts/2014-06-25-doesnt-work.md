![Doesn't Work](/assets/images/posts/2014/doesnt-work.png)

**"Doesn't work"** is a killer reply to every constructive tutorial, every comprehensive material, and every ingenious invention ever created.

It is an ignorant's way of saying *"yeah man I don't know how to use it so it doesn't work."*

Don't be that lazy not to even explain why it *"doesn't work"* and *"why it doesn't work only to you."*

>Ignorance is bliss only if the meaning of bliss is idiocy.
