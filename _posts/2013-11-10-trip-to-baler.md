On November 1 to 3, me, my sister and some of my officemates from PULP took a vacation to the beautiful beach and falls at [Baler, Aurora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baler,_Aurora). I'd let the photos tell the story.

I had to suffer 3 days of sore body because I never really was physically prepared to trek 30 minutes up and down a ultra-mega rocky wet path to the Mother falls, and 1 hour of surfing. (Thanks to [Sagasa Surfshop](https://www.facebook.com/SagasaSurfshop)!) At the end of the day, all that remains are the fun memories and experiences from all the things we did in Baler. We'll be back!
