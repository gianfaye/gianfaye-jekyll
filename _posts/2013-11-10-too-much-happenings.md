I'd post all of them in a collective. When I get to have so much happenings I tend to divert myself to thinking too much. And as I suggested on [my previous post](/blog/everyday-is-a-starting-point/), thinking too much is not a good thing. On the other hand, I'm grateful that most of the things that occur in the past weeks were a blessing.

##Hackathon

If you read some of my previous posts, I posted about me and my partner's preparation to the Microsoft Philippines Openness Hackathon which was moved to October 26 to 27.

- [Windows 8 App Dev Boot Camp](/blog/windows-8-app-dev-bootcamp/)

First off, it was an overwhelming experience to be able to join the hackathon. It was my first hackathon and obviously (as I had so much fun) won't be the last. I'd like to thank my intern-gone-hackathon partner, Jennifer Arroyo, for sticking with me and sharing all the fun. 

The most fun part is, having to bring your concepts and ideas to life. The app we developed it titled **MOOCsage**. If you are familiar with [MOOCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) or Massive Open Online Courses, this app is for those who take the courses on various MOOC providers and wanted to get all your learning materials and deadlines in one place.

We went to the Azure Camp before the hackathon and learned to deploy apps to Windows Azure. We created our initial web app interface using Node.js and Backbone.js. To view the app, you can go to [moocsageapp.azurewebsites.net](http://moocsageapp.azurewebsites.net/) Here's some of the screenshots:

The app won't just end there (hackathon) and we have decided even before we joined the hackathon that we'll be continuing developing and improving the app to make it in use and deliver it to my fellow MOOC sages. :)

##New Employment

I am [resigning from my post as a full-time employee on PULP](/blog/live-loud). I'd still be their Webmaster and I'll  be working for them part-time when they just need my help (technical support) and consultation. 

I am now proud to be joining [Nova Founders](http://www.novafounders.com) on their journey to world domination in the entrepreneurial sense. This opens a new path to enhance my present skills and have the opportunity to learn from working on a team.

##Baler, Aurora

On November 1 to 3, me, my sister and some of my officemates from PULP took a vacation to the beautiful beach and falls at [Baler, Aurora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baler,_Aurora). I'd let the photos tell the story.

I had to suffer 3 days of sore body because I never really was physically prepared to trek 30 minutes up and down a ultra-mega rocky wet path to the Mother falls, and 1 hour of surfing. (Thanks to [Sagasa Surfshop](https://www.facebook.com/SagasaSurfshop)!) At the end of the day, all that remains are the fun memories and experiences from all the things we did in Baler. We'll be back!

##Typhoon Yolanda

Just this Friday, November 8, our country has encountered [the strongest typhoon in the planet ever recorded in modern history](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/11/131108-supertyphoon-haiyan-yolanda-atmosphere-climate-change/) - Yolanda also known globally as Haiyan. We in Metro Manila were spared the devastation because it [shifted its path in the last minute](http://www.unbox.ph/editorials/to-our-manila-readers-a-miracle-happened-so-please-help-yolanda-victims/) but our kababayan in Visayas were totally in a terrible situation as of this typing.
