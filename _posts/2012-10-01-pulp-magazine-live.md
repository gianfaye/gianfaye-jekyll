The website serves as a preview portal to the latest PULP Magazine issue. We designed and developed a custom content management system to suit the needs of the brand online. We also developed a map widget to help the visitors track the stores where the magazine is currently available. The website's design theme is updated monthly to go with the magazine's monthly publication. Co-developed with John Louie Vera and interns Jeniffer Arroyo and Carlo Villoria.
