**PULP Magazine** is the biggest and the oldest (since 1999) premier music publication in the Philippines. 

##The Site

The website serves as a preview portal of the latest published issue and as a wayback machine and provides information of their back issues. We built a custom CMS and features different sections (e.g. News, Blog, Column, Reviews) to publish different types of content which is all managed through an admin panel we also developed in PHP/MySQL.

We also developed a mini-web application for the map widget to help the visitors track the stores where the magazine is currently available. 

The website's design theme is updated monthly to go with the magazine's monthly publication. 

##Client

PULP Magazine is published by The Fookien Times Yearbook Publishing Co.
