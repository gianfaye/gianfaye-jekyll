Companies who always threaten you that there are other people who can have your job do not truly invest on making their employees be the best least they care about you growing or not.

If they are willing to scratch you out and start all over again with that next poor thing in line for **your job**, then, you are nothing more of a roll of disposable toilet paper to them. 

Remember: **You were not born to wipe their asses and take their shit every time they feel crap.**

Why in 6 angels bazinga are you still wasting your time?
