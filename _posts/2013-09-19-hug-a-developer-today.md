I happen to chance running into this video from the [WebGeekPH Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgeekph/).

A number of developers around the world could relate, not specifically with what they indicated on their boards, but you get the gist.

##What we really need

Of course, it's a video created for fun. But it tackles an important part on the developer workforce and how we wanted to be treated as a developer.

While writing this, I, myself, am suffering from a consequence I didn't sign up for. I am stuck at home, writing this post on Sublime Text, because I can't go to work in the office.

> All I wanted was to get to my desk, code, and finish something.

__Why can't I get to work?__ Just a few weeks back my employer implemented a new rule - a 4pm cut off - which means we are not allowed to go inside our office if we happen to be late after 4pm.

##I smell bullshit

Well, after I took a bite out of that job interview where I was informed of the 'free-world' work environment and the supposedly 'flexible' schedule did I realize it really isn't the sweet cake I was imagining it was. I was assigned at "12pm I should be at work" scheme but it didn't work. I've had received memos in the past related to my supposedly 'tardiness', but it didn't work as I still go to the office late. Those memos threatened me to remove me from my post if I'd be late again but I did and the termination didn't happen. Now they implemented this "4pm cut off" and they reasoned out "for security reasons" but still let outsiders in and out at 6pm.

Sometimes, shit happens and you can't prevent it. One day, I went to the office 3 min late of their 4pm cut off, and wasn't allowed to go in. What a waste of transpo, in addition to the fact that I get less than half of [the average salary of a web developer](http://www.staff.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/MyStaff-Infograph_Average-Salaries.jpg) suppose to get. I even had a deadline that day. And so I did it at home, wasn't paid for that day, and suffered half of my gross on payday.

##Why the fuck am I still here?

Long story short, I'm in love with the brand - the identity. It is something eternal. But the organization sucks. The management sucks. (It is obvious if you get to meet and bid farewell to new co-workers almost every month.) And just because I care about the brand doesn't mean I have to suffer this way eternally.

##Are you crazy!? What if...

Don't worry though, I doubt they'll be reading this unless you're an asshole. They have little to no idea what I'm actually doing. Even if I did better work or anything outstanding they wouldn't notice as they have no idea what I'm actually doing. And I'm not seeking recognition. God, they even asked me to remove my credits to the websites I developed for them - *more of this will be discussed later*. I'm fine with what I do. Just __let me do it__. Don't lock me away from my canvas. I just have to finish one remaining project and **I'm done**. But I can't. I'm at home, typing this shit and waiting for Friday.

I wish I could get them this book: ["Why Programmers Work At Night"](https://leanpub.com/nightowls) or better yet ["Linchpin" by Seth Godin](http://amzn.to/18ekKGP).

If you are an employer, you might want to make your developer employees suffer less by (1) **understanding what they actually do**, (2) **working your ass off to be able to pay them adequately**, and (3) **provide flexible schedule on their working days**. 

> Creativity is intelligence having fun. - Albert Einstein

As most of the people didn't know, [programming is a creative endeavor](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/). We are not automated machines, we are [creative](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity/) human beings who enjoy technical challenges and have bills to pay.

We need no hugs, we demand better treatment. No, we deserve them. 

If you can't provide them then you do not deserve us.
