I happen to chance running into this video from the [WebGeekPH Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webgeekph/).

A number of developers around the world could relate, not specifically with what they indicated on their boards, but you get the gist.

##What we really need

Of course, it's a video created for fun. But it tackles an important part on the developer workforce and how we wanted to be treated as a developer.

While writing this, I, myself, am suffering from a consequence I didn't sign up for. I am stuck at home, writing this post on Sublime Text, because I can't go to work in the office.

> All I wanted was to get to my desk, code, and finish something.

**\*insert some lengthy rant which I decided to cut\***

I wish I could get them this book: ["Why Programmers Work At Night"](https://leanpub.com/nightowls) or better yet ["Linchpin" by Seth Godin](http://amzn.to/18ekKGP).

If you are an employer, you might want to make your developer employees suffer less by (1) **understanding what they actually do**, (2) **working your ass off to be able to pay them adequately**, and (3) **provide flexible schedule on their working days**.

As most of the people didn't know, [programming is a creative endeavor](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/). We are not automated machines, we are [creative](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity/) human beings who enjoy technical challenges and have bills to pay.

We need no hugs, we demand better treatment. No, we deserve them. 

If you can't provide them then you do not deserve us.
