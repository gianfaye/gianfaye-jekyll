So there was this company who uses and put the Apple mantra "[Think different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different)" on their website. If you're not familiar with it, here it goes:

>Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. But the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

The funny thing is, they do not actually know what this means. I went to meet with their business manager to talk about opportunities and introducing myself and what I do. Upon seeing the Apple mantra on their website, I assumed that they're not like the other companies who discriminate night owls and oblige them to work on a fixed typical-9-to-5 schedule. So with this assumption, I showed them who I really am and how I do things. And most of you who I worked with know how defiant I am of rules. I am the very definition of anti-establishment and non-conformity.

So after a few days I followed up with an email and got this response (just an excerpt): *"Thank you for sending this. Unfortunately I have to tell you that I would find it difficult to work with somebody who has problems sticking to the rules."*

Oops. You just revealed how opposite you are of what you branded yourselves. 

BEWARE of pretentious startups. I have been a victim of one, and won't be a victim again.

**Don't be fooled by the couch.**
