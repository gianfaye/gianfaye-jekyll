You know we all have different kinds of friends. I'm not sounding like I have _lots_ of friends. To be quite honest, I'm picky with whom I really socialize with.

So being in the topic, you may have encountered these type of people who always joke around. They are actually fun to be with. I'm typically boring without these people and they're like that clown from your 7th birthday party. 

##They're jokers

While I was watching [Freaks and Geeks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193676/) (spoiler alert if you haven't watched it yet), there's [this scene](http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/freaksandgeeks/nick-andopolis/#Weve_Got_Spirit) between Nick and Lindsay that totally got me.

**Why so serious?** Even before this famous Joker line got to the mainstream audience, we already have jokers. 

Wanna talk about how you got this non-contagious illness that sounded like a bomb? Don't share it with your joker friend. Wanna talk about how you dropped out of college because you think the current education system sucks? Don't share it with your joker friend. Heard a great song talking about serious shit and stuff like finding yourself or going against a movement or propaganda? Don't share it with your joker friend.

All they think about is puns and formulating jokes with every word you said.

##Only serious when intoxicated

**Friday nights!** This is some kind of the revelation day within your group of friends. Get drunk and spill all those beans. Your joker friends suddenly became more hyper as the night is young aside from the fact that it's already 3am. This is all your chance to actually talk to your joker friends and extend the heights from the funniest thing to the most depressing thing in your life. Ha. 

##What lines?

The part that sucked the most is the fact that most of these type of friends don't care about crossing the lines. Or, they wouldn't even know something like that existed. Duh, we're _friends_.

> There's a thin line between entertainment and exploitation.

The intensity of how your joker friends joke may vary. Some joker friends would only go 50% and would actually know how to not cross the line. But some would be a total nutcase go a [100%](http://claymore.wikia.com/wiki/Awakened_Being). 

These 100% joker beings would actually think that it's funny sharing about how one of your friends trip off the hill last Friday night and land on his nose, naked. Sometimes you laugh with it. But wait 'til it's you who've done something outrageous, your joker friend will shout it out to your whole office first-thing on Monday.

Don't get me wrong, I love my joker friends. And I like [Barney Stinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson). But it's quite difficult getting along with them 24/7. You sometimes need a break from kidding and get shit real.

Joker friends are like _paprika_ - sometimes you like it to spice your meal. Get too much of it and you'll probably hate it.
