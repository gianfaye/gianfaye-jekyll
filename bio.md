#Bio

I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek and a lifelong autodidact from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development for 5 years and I'm currently focusing on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

##Manifesto

I decided to include a manifesto on my bio page so the visitors of this site could get a slight idea of who I am and how I do things. Read at your own risk.

**As an autodidact**, the constant learning and coping up with the latest web technologies is what drives me forward in this field. New things emerge everyday. What I know last month could already be obsolete next week. There was someone who told me in the past that they chose to take Computer Engineering over Information Technology because they find IT less challenging as it doesn't require you to pass a licensure exam. Let them take the job of updating the questionnaires every exam period and we'll see if they can keep their sanity intact. Even the scope of IT itself is enough to make them go crazy. Learning shouldn't be something that is taken for the name and glory. Learning is a passion. Glory comes after you pursue your passion.

**As a designer**, I know what works and what doesn't. Design isn't just entirely about aesthetics. Many people see design as just typography, colors, shadows, depth, and geometry. Design is about how we use all of them to tell a story - to create or revive an idea. A bad design is a badly executed storytelling that will bore your audience and make your story a yawn fest or a lame party. It's important to get your story right with design that works properly.

**As a developer**, I write clean codes that won't make the next developer handling the project scream out of agony. This is very commonly disregarded resulting to a phenomenon called *I-better-start-from-scratch-than-to-read-and-maintain-someone-elses-code*. All developers could relate, so a neat and properly documented code is a must. Also, [programming is a creative endeavor](/blog/hug-a-developer-today/). Even though developers are often at the lowest branch in the hierarchy of a product development structure, we are not cogs in a machine. We should always be given the opportunity to provide input. We are not just someone who you hire to code because you can't.

**As an artist**, I hate being told what to do. I squirm at instructions and choke on rules. I suffocate at merely the inch sight of what looks like a cubicle. I despise micromanagement. I am the very definition of **anti-establishment** and **nonconformity**. I love being given the opportunity to do what I do best; to be able to explore and create; and to be trusted that I can do my job as a professional. People who micromanage fail first thing at hiring. That's the inconvenient truth.

##Work

I'm presently working as an independent contractor. 

* Web Developer (2013 - 2014) [Nova Founders](http://novafounders.com) under Nova Fabrik Development Team
* Web Developer (2011 - 2013) [PULP Magazine](http://pulpmagazinelive.com) & [PULP Live World](http://pulpliveworld.com)
* Web Designer  (2010 - 2012) [Innodan Pte. Ltd. Singapore](http://www.innodan.com/)

##Education

I studied BS in Information Technology at [De La Salle University - Dasmariñas](http://www.dlsud.edu.ph/) from 2007 to 2010 under the [DOST RA 7687 Scholarship](http://region4a.dost.gov.ph/databases/scho_details.php?studid=2897). People are often surprised to know that, with only 2 semesters remaining, I dropped out and resort to my autodidactism. I don't trust the current education curriculum and I don't like that education is more of a business than actually being a learning and training ground. 

##Skills

If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, contact me and I'll send you my resume. My current expertise is on front-end development doing mostly markup. If you would (and I recommend especially for HR people) read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be 70% The Creative, 30% The Coder on my way to being The Core. (Hell yeah!) And yes, I can do HTML/CSS like a maniac.

##Publications

Around 2010 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web development. (Who would believe it got me my first job?) The blogging community is a very interesting market - I met lots of interesting people and was introduced to a wide range of topics and niche.

Here are some of the articles I scattered around the interwebs:

##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in **computer forensics**, anything about **InfoSec**, the **maker culture**, the **Internet of Things**, and **MOOC**. If I'm not tinkering stuff on the internets, you can catch me watching video lectures on [Coursera](https://trello.com/b/3mel45WE/coursera). I also enjoy casually learning languages from [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) and I'm currently learning **French**.

##Fandom

Let's talk about our fandom! I am <s>fond of</s> obsessed with Doctor Who, Supernatural, Sherlock Holmes and his deductions, The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, Hannibal, Star Wars, Seth Godin's head, Isaac Asimov, Japan, playing casual MTG, polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, films by Darren Aronofsky and Lars Von Trier, scores by Clint Mansell, trying my best to fly a chopper on GTA, making gyrocopters fly, listening to Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, Arctic Monkeys, MCR, post-hardcore and symphonic metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, Schubert's Standchen, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. 

I have 2 cats, a red-eared slider, and a box turtle.
