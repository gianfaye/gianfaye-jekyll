# Hello, there.

I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development since 2010 and currently focused on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

## Skillset

###### Verified by: **[Pluralsight Role IQ Skill Assessment](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/gianfaye)** (as of April 2, 2020)

If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, [contact me](mailto:contact@gianfaye.com) and I will send you my CV. My current expertise is on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

If you would read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be <strong>The Core</strong> -- heading towards being full-stack. 

My approach to design is mainly intuitive but I'm familiar with most of the textbook concepts such as the Gestalt principles and common design patterns.

My current snack is <strong>ReactJS</strong> messing up with components and states.

## Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in **computer forensics**, anything about **InfoSec**, the **maker culture**, and the **Internet of Things**. If I'm not tinkering stuff on [the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg), I'll probably be tinkering things IRL.
