#Bio

Hi! My name is **Gian Faye**, a ( > 20 && < 25) y/o web geek from the Philippines. Although most people over the phone [and the internet](/assets/images/not-a-sir.jpg)) addresses me as a 'Sir', the hell I'm not. (I blame it on the dark tone of my voice, though.) Now that you are cleared I'm not a 'Sir,' we can move on. 

##Work

I'm presently working as the web developer (and apparently webmaster) for [PULP Magazine](http://pulpmagazinelive.com), the premier music magazine of the Philippines and [PULP Live World Production](http://pulpliveworld.com) by which I developed (and maintain) three web [projects](/projects) and one mobile app dev't in progress.

In before PULP (from late 2011 to early 2012), I did web projects for [Innodan Pte. Ltd.](http://www.innodan.com/) which is based in Singapore. 

##Education

I didn't graduate from [De La Salle University - Dasmariñas](http://www.dlsud.edu.ph/). I spent the longest 4 years there for which 2% of the things I learned could I only apply for my work. I took *BS* in Information Technology while under the [DOST RA 7687 Scholarship](http://region4a.dost.gov.ph/databases/scho_details.php?studid=2897), _link contains an address but not my current so don't bother_. I dropped out and resort to my autodidactism.

##Languages/Frameworks

Although I'm language agnostic, I'm looking forward to using JavaScript more often for the projects I'll be working on in the future. I've had history with PHP/MySQL, friended jQuery, but I'm seriously checking out Backbone.js, Node.js, Python, and Ruby. 

##Publications

Around 2009 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I got my jobs and went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web dev't. (And it got me my first job.)

##Lack of Talent 

One day I wanted to learn how to play the cello but ended up practicing with a viola since it's more affordable and they're both C G D A. After my acoustic viola died, I bought an electric violin for which I still suck at playing. I had bands in the past where I messed with the electric guitar and making the guitar fanatics' ears bleed because of the horrible notes I produce.

##Personality

I took a test at [mypersonality.info](http://www.mypersonality.info/gianfaye/) and got this neat result. I am including this on my website as I think this is an almost perfect analysis of how I think. There are lots of tests out there but I think this is one closest to accuracy.

It says: "**INTJ - The Strategist**: INTJs are introspective, analytical, determined persons with natural leadership ability. Being reserved, they prefer to stay in the background while leading. Strategic, knowledgable and adaptable, INTJs are talented in bringing ideas from conception to reality. They expect perfection from themselves as well as others and are comfortable with the leadership of another so long as they are competent. INTJs can also be described as decisive, open-minded, self-confident, attentive, theoretical and pragmatic."

In that case...

##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am fond of astronomy, Star Wars, Doctor Who, The Big Bang Theory, Hannibal, Seth Godin, Japan, MOOCs, polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, GTA, gyrocopters, Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, MCR, some post-hardcore to black metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. 

I have 3 cats and a red-eared slider.
