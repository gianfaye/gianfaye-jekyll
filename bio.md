#Bio

Hi! My name is **Gian Faye**, a web geek from the Philippines. Although most people over the phone [and the internet](/assets/images/bio/not-a-sir.jpg)) addresses me as a 'Sir', the heck I'm not. (I blame it on the dark tone of my voice, though.) Now that you are cleared I'm not a 'Sir,' we can move on. 

##Work

I've been doing web design and development for 5 years. I've been working as a web developer (professionally) for 3 years now.

I'm presently working as a consulting webmaster for [PULP Magazine](http://pulpmagazinelive.com), the premier music magazine of the Philippines and [PULP Live World Production](http://pulpliveworld.com) by which I was a full-time web developer from 2011 to 2013 and developed (and maintain) three web [projects](/projects).

I also worked as a consulting web developer under the Nova Fabrik development team for [Nova Founders](http://novafounders.com). I also did web design projects for [Innodan Pte. Ltd.](http://www.innodan.com/) which is based in Singapore. 

##Education

I did not graduate from [De La Salle University - Dasmariñas](http://www.dlsud.edu.ph/). I spent the longest 4 years there for which 2% of the things I learned could I only apply for my work. I took *BS* in Information Technology while under the [DOST RA 7687 Scholarship](http://region4a.dost.gov.ph/databases/scho_details.php?studid=2897), _link contains an address but not my current so don't bother_. I dropped out and resort to my autodidactism.

##Skills, eh?

I have used the following libraries and frameworks on my previous works and projects: Backbone.js & CanJS (JS libraries/MVC frameworks), NodeJS (JS for server-side apps), jQuery and jQuery UI (JS libraries), PhoneGap (framework for porting mobile apps), WebGL (JS graphics library), Jekyll (static-site parser, uses Ruby & Markdown), Business Catalyst (CMS & CRM), Joomla (yes, that CMS you know) and WordPress (CMS). I know basic PHP and have used the WAMP combo in the past. In regard to templating, I know Bootstrap 3, EJS, and Mustache. 

I mainly use Sublime Text 2 as my code editor. I draft wireframes on a dotted sketchbook (call it traditional, but nothing beats paper and pencil in drafting) and do prototyping in GIMP 2 (or Photoshop, if necessary). I mostly do wireframing-straight-to-document unless the prototype is necessary (mostly for client-work).

I am familiar with Git and SCM, and Scrum methodology. I timebox and manage my tasks using Google Calendar and [Trello](http://trello.com/gianfaye), respectively.

You can find me learning new things to code at [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/users/22010), [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/users/gianfaye), and [Coderbits](https://coderbits.com/gianfaye).

I like working with the DOM, putting APIs to their proper places like a boss (jk), and learning new and emerging web technologies. 

##Publications

Around 2009 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web development. (And who would believe it got me my first job?) 

Here are some of the articles I scattered around the interwebs:

* #####[PULP Magazine "Is Crowdfunding the Future of Music Production?"](http://pulpmagazinelive.com/column/new-shit/crowdfunding-future-of-music-production)
#####July 12, 2013 // For "The New Shit" Column

* #####[Free Software Foundation – “No to Windows 7; No to Facebook?”](http://www.blogengage.com/blogger/free-software-foundation-no-to-windows-7-no-to-facebook/)
#####June 13, 2011 // Where I made me won a [Contest](http://www.blogengage.com/blogger/the-june-2011-blogger-spotlight-winners/) (yay)

I can't recall all the links but I swear I've posted more. If you happen to find some of the old articles I posted, feel free to email me.

##Lack of Talent 

One day I wanted to learn how to play the cello but ended up practicing with a viola since it's more affordable and they're both the same keys. After my acoustic viola died, I bought an electric violin for which I still suck at playing. I had bands [in the past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqGovbV22JY) where I messed with the electric guitar and making the listeners' ears bleed because of the horrible melodies I produce.


##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am <s>fond of</s> obsessed with astronomy, Doctor Who, Supernatural, Sherlock Holmes and his deductions, The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, Hannibal, Star Wars, Seth Godin's head, Japan, MOOCs, polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, films by Darren Aronofsky and Lars Von Trier, scores by Clint Mansell, hitting people and cars on GTA, making gyrocopters fly, listening to Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, Arctic Monkeys, MCR, post-hardcore and black metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, Schubert's Standchen, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. 

I have 2 cats, a red-eared slider, and a box turtle.


Now that I've said shameless things about myself just so you have any idea who you're dealing with, please close this page and go back to the [home page](/).
