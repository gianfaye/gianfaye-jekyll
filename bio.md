I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek and a lifelong autodidact from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development for 5 years and I'm currently focusing on **front-end development** and **UX design**. I can manipulate your entire experience with a web page or an app. I can make you feel hungry. I can make you go mad. I can even make you cry if I wanted to. I can make you want to buy a product I want to sell. 

#Manifesto

I decided to include a manifesto on my bio page so the visitors of this page could get a slight idea of who I am. You may or may not like me after reading this. Read at your own risk.

As an autodidact, the constant learning and coping up with the latest web technologies is what drives me forward in this field. New things emerge everyday. What I know last month, could already be obsolete next week.

As a designer, I know what works and what doesn't. Design isn't just entirely about aesthetics. Many people see design as just typography, colors, shadows, depth, and geometry. Design is about how we use all of them to tell a story - to create or revive an idea.

As a developer, I write clean codes that won't make the next developer handling the project scream out of agony. This is very commonly disregarded resulting to a phenomenon called *I-better-start-from-scratch-than-to-read-and-maintain-someone-elses-code*. 

As an artist, I hate being told what to do. I hate instructions. I hate being trapped inside a cubicle. I hate micromanagement. I am the very definition of **anti-establishment** and **nonconformity**. I love being given the opportunity to do what I do best, to be able to explore and create my own path, and to be trusted that I can do my job as a professional.

> Creativity is putting things together. Good design is making it work.

Let's work together and create something good.

If you would (and I recommend especially for HR people) read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be 80% The Creative, 20% The Coder on my way to being The Core. (Hell yeah!) And yes, I can do HTML/CSS like a maniac.

##Publications

Around 2009 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web development. (Who would believe it got me my first job?) The blogging community is a very interesting market - I met lots of interesting people and was introduced to a wide range of topics and niche.

Here are some of the articles I scattered around the interwebs:

* #####[PULP Magazine "Is Crowdfunding the Future of Music Production?"](http://pulpmagazinelive.com/column/new-shit/crowdfunding-future-of-music-production)
 July 12, 2013 // For "The New Shit" Column

* #####[Free Software Foundation – “No to Windows 7; No to Facebook?”](http://www.blogengage.com/blogger/free-software-foundation-no-to-windows-7-no-to-facebook/)
 June 13, 2011 // Where I made me won a [Contest](http://www.blogengage.com/blogger/the-june-2011-blogger-spotlight-winners/) (yay)

##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in computer forensics, and anything about InfoSec. I also enjoy casually learning languages from [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com) currently learning French.

##Fandom

Let's talk about our fandom! I am <s>fond of</s> obsessed with Doctor Who, Supernatural, Sherlock Holmes and his deductions, The Big Bang Theory, Game of Thrones, Hannibal, Star Wars, Seth Godin's head, Isaac Asimov, Japan, MOOCs, polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, films by Darren Aronofsky and Lars Von Trier, scores by Clint Mansell, trying my best to fly a chopper on GTA, making gyrocopters fly, listening to Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, Arctic Monkeys, MCR, post-hardcore and symphonic metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, Schubert's Standchen, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. 

I have 2 cats, a red-eared slider, and a box turtle.
