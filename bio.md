#Bio

Hi! My name is **Gian Faye**, a ( > 20 && < 25) y/o web geek from the Philippines. Although most people over the phone addresses me as a 'Sir', the hell I'm not. (I blame it on the deep dark tone of my voice.) Now that you are cleared I'm not a 'Sir,' we can move on.

##Work

I'm presently working as the web developer (and apparently webmaster) for [PULP Magazine](http://pulpmagazinelive.com), the premier music magazine of the Philippines and [PULP Live World Production](http://pulpliveworld.com) by which I developed (and maintain) three web projects and one mobile app dev't in progress.

In before PULP (from late 2011 to early 2012), I did web projects for [Innodan Pte. Ltd.](http://www.innodan.com/) which is based in Singapore. 
##Education

I didn't graduate from [De La Salle University - DasmariÃ±as](http://www.dlsud.edu.ph/). I spent the longest 4 years there for which 2% of the things I learned could I only apply for my work. I took *BS* in Information Technology while under the [DOST RA 7687 Scholarship](http://region4a.dost.gov.ph/databases/scho_details.php?studid=2897), _link contains an address but not my current so don't bother_. I dropped out and resort to my autodidactism.

##Languages/Frameworks

Although I'm language agnostic, I'm looking forward to using JavaScript more often for the projects I'll be working on in the future. I've had history with PHP/MySQL, friended jQuery, but I'm seriously checking out Backbone.js, Node.js and Ruby.

##Publications

Around 2009 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I got my jobs and went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web dev't. (And it got me my first job.)

##Lack of Talent 

Once day I wanted to learn how to play the cello but ended up practicing with a viola since it's more affordable and they're both C G D A. After my acoustic viola died, I bought an electric violin for which I still suck at playing. I had bands in the past where I messed with the eletric guitar and making the guitar fanatics' ears bleed because of the horrible notes I produce.

##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am fond of astronomy, Star Wars, Doctor Who, The Big Bang Theory, Hannibal, Seth Godin, Japan, MOOC, polymaths, GTA, gyrocopters, Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, MCR, some post-hardcore to black metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. I have 3 cats and a red-eared slider.


Now that I've said shameless things about me just so you have any idea who you're dealing with, please close this page and go back to the [home page](/).
