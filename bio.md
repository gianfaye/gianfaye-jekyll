# Hello, there.

I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development since 2010 and currently focused on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

## Skillset

If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, [contact me](mailto:contact@gianfaye.com) and I will send you my CV. My current expertise is on front-end development and user experience. 

If you would read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be <strong>The Core</strong> -- heading towards being full-stack. (Backend devs, beware.) 

My approach to design is mainly intuitive but I'm familiar with most of the textbook concepts such as Gestalt principles and common design patterns.

My current snack is <strong>ReactJS</strong> messing up with components and states.

## Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in **computer forensics**, anything about **InfoSec**, the **maker culture**, and the **Internet of Things**. If I'm not tinkering stuff on [the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg), I'll probably be tinkering things IRL.
