# Bio

I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development for 7 years and I'm currently focusing on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

## Skillset

If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, [contact me](mailto:contact@gianfaye.com) and I will send you my CV. My current expertise is on front-end development and UX.  If you would read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be 70% The Creative, 30% The Coder. I'm more avid to the markup and styling side of things but I can work with vanilla JS, jQuery, and REST APIs.

## Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in **computer forensics**, anything about **InfoSec**, the **maker culture**, and the **Internet of Things**. If I'm not tinkering stuff on [the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg), I'll probably be tinkering things IRL.
