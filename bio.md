# Bio

I'm **Gian Faye**, a web geek from the Philippines. I've been doing web design and development for 5 years and I'm currently focusing on **front-end development** and **user experience design**. 

## Work

I'm presently working as a Front-End Developer for a Singapore-based company.

## Skills

If you are interested to know more about my skills and the tools I use, [contact me](mailto:contact@gianfaye.com). My current expertise is on front-end development and UX -- from wireframes to markup and CSS. If you would read this article: [The Front End Engineering Spectrum- The Three Generic Types of Front End Engineers](http://htmlcssjavascript.com/web/the-front-end-engineering-spectrum-the-three-generic-types-of-front-end-engineers/) I'd be 70% The Creative, 30% The Coder. 

## Publications

Around 2010 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://www.loading-info.com), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Even so, it was my headstart on gaining interest in web development. (Who would believe it got me my first job?) The blogging community is a very interesting market - I met interesting people and was introduced to a wide range of topics and niche.

Here are some of the articles I scattered around the interwebs:

## Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am very interested in **forensic science** specializing in **computer forensics**, anything about **InfoSec**, the **maker culture**, the **Internet of Things**, and **MOOC**.
