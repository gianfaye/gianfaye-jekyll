#Bio

Hi! My name is **Gian Faye**, a ( > 20 && < 25) y/o web geek from the Philippines. Although most people over the phone [and the internet](/assets/images/bio/not-a-sir.jpg)) addresses me as a 'Sir', the hell I'm not. (I blame it on the dark tone of my voice, though.) Now that you are cleared I'm not a 'Sir,' we can move on. 

##Work

I'm presently working as a consulting webmaster for [PULP Magazine](http://pulpmagazinelive.com), the premier music magazine of the Philippines and [PULP Live World Production](http://pulpliveworld.com) by which I developed (and maintain) three web [projects](/projects).

In before PULP (from late 2011 to early 2012), I did web projects for [Innodan Pte. Ltd.](http://www.innodan.com/) which is based in Singapore. 

##Education

I didn't graduate from [De La Salle University - DasmariÃ±as](http://www.dlsud.edu.ph/). I spent the longest 4 years there for which 2% of the things I learned could I only apply for my work. I took *BS* in Information Technology while under the [DOST RA 7687 Scholarship](http://region4a.dost.gov.ph/databases/scho_details.php?studid=2897), _link contains an address but not my current so don't bother_. I dropped out and resort to my autodidactism.

##Languages/Frameworks

Although I'm language agnostic, I'm looking forward to using JavaScript more often for the projects I'll be working on in the future. I've had history with PHP/MySQL, friended jQuery, tried Backbone, CanJS, and Node.JS.  

##Publications

Around 2009 I started up a blog, [Loading-Info](http://the.loading-info.net), where I posted tech-related articles. It's still live but since I went serious with web dev't, my blogging activities dropped. Nonetheless, the blogging thing was a headstart on how I started to gain interest in web dev't. (And it got me my first job.)

##Lack of Talent 

One day I wanted to learn how to play the cello but ended up practicing with a viola since it's more affordable and they're both C G D A. After my acoustic viola died, I bought an electric violin for which I still suck at playing. I had bands in the past where I messed with the electric guitar and making the listeners' ears bleed because of the horrible notes I produce.


##Interests

Aside from web technologies, I am <s>fond of</s> obsessed with astronomy, Star Wars, Doctor Who, Sherlock Holmes and his deductions, The Big Bang Theory, Hannibal, Seth Godin's head, Japan, MOOCs, polymaths like Leonardo da Vinci, films by Darren Aronofsky and Lars Von Trier, scores by Clint Mansell, hitting people and cars on GTA, making gyrocopters fly, listening to Marilyn Manson, Apocalyptica, MCR, post-hardcore and black metal bands, Maksim Mrvica, and Edvard Grieg's intro on his Piano Concerto in A minor Op. 16. 

I have 3 cats, a red-eared slider, and a box turtle.


Now that I've said shameless things about myself just so you have any idea who you're dealing with, please close this page and go back to the [home page](/).
